A. Thin workers are instantaneous.

B. For any Dask worker, absolutely set up a single worker process + Seamless spawn. 
Dask has no smart intra-worker IPC.

C. Dask is eager. 

1. Fat worker and fat checksum tasks are only to be submitted when needed (by a dependent Dask-submitted worker).
In case of fat workers, the base future stays alive so no problem of work being lost.

2. Case 2 Transformations create a base future, a thin future and/or a fat future
as transformation attributes. They are created only when needed. Once the transformation is
complete (or constructed manually), Transformation.transformation_checksum is set, 
and they are entered under transformation_checksum into the Dask future cache 
for Case 1 transformations (if not existing).
The fat future is also entered under result_checksum into the fat checksum cache (if not existing).
